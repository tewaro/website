title: About
---

I'm a researcher in Arch and OS Co-Design. I currently work on the [LDOS](https://ldos.utexas.edu/)
project designing OS constructs for rapid policy development. My projects focus on Developer
Experience both for real people and LLMs.

In my free time I ruck, hike, play pickleball, and bike.
