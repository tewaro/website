        <h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Conspiracy theorists and scientists have a really key thing in common: They both focus on
questioning the world around them. The <strong>key</strong> difference is the supposed to be the philosophical
grounding. Scientists are supposed to accept the key assumptions of Occam’s razor <span class="citation" data-cites="occam">[1]</span> and
provide support to the academic institutions.</p>
<p>Right now, at least in the field of computer science, Scientists have abandoned upholding academic
institutions. Completely and Utterly.</p>
<p>In my field of systems we’ve produced for the world the technical designs for everything from the
smallest chip used in tiny GPS trackers to the scale of the internet. We know how to build these
things and measure their impact. We know how to reshape all the technology that people interact with
on a daily basis. We know how to do all this and measure it.</p>
<p>It might be weird that I’m seemingly conflating the people in CS Research and Industry, but that is
the crux of the problem… Industry has gotten a LOT of people who do want to do Scientific
Research, because there are genuine problems that require Research to solve.</p>
<p>These are also the same people creating the systems that actually run your ChatGPT or Claude query.
They map your request through the internet to a specific computer somewhere figure out how to run
this ‘‘LLM’” thing and respond with the output. All of that happens in a matter of milliseconds so
it looks like the model is doing something constantly. So now ask yourself if there are all of these
smart people working on this surely they must be paying attention to the massive environmental cost.
Surely, all these smart people wouldn’t just leave us high and dry to die?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert history tells us that they absolutely will, not that they won’t try to fix it.
Anthropic is the latest in attempts to make what they view as inevitable palatable.
The recent response to the Superbowl commercial about ads is just the latest in enshitification.
‘‘We won’t ever add ads’’, seems to be a hollow and empty promise. The only system I trusted not to
have ads was the governments, until a naked Fascist destroyed the separation that exists between
politics and citizen support in the government.</p>
<p>On that topic the initial part of this post has been slightly disingenuous. There are actually a
really good group of CS systems folks that do care about improving the daily lives of people.
However, these people generally don’t work at any company you have ever heard of, or even the ones
popping off in the Fortune 500 space. I’m taking about national laboratories. This is where the job
of improving people’s lives by filling out the infrastructure of government actually happens. You
want COVID vaccine data secure? National Labs. You want your electricity and your power cheaper,
faster, and more efficiently? National Labs. You want nukes not to blow us all to kingdom come?
National Labs.</p>
<p>So after this brief aside, reader, you might be wondering what exactly does upholding academic
institutions mean? In a philosophical sense it means when scientists working on the cutting edge of
a field observe that certain work could have negative impacts, the community as a consensus whole
should come out and condemn the people engaging in such behavior. Condemnation serves as a warning
to people who will consume and use that work. It also serves as a clear indication of what the
best available scientific knowledge has to offer discussions on politics and practical regulation
for the benefit of individual people. An example of this effort can be found in our sister field,
Security. The security community sent an open letter about the fact that the elections were secure,
to combat the fascist-in-chiefs ‘‘Big Lie’’.</p>
<p>Concretely, upholding the academic institutions means coming to terms with the fact that our choices
might kill all of you. Because those same choices will pay for our lifestyle improvements while the
rest of society discombobulates and people die. Eventually, the work we do will come back to bite
us, but there are a lot of non-systems people that’ll have to die before we feel it. At the same
time, every professor in my field <strong>already knows this</strong> and yet they will still submit or work on
countless papers that speed up the destruction of society. I am not exempt from this critique, in
order to graduate I will do the same. We know we are all gonna choke on carbon. We know that human
contact will slowly be replaced by LLMs and everything can be monitored all the time. But where
ethics should have us actually do something, we are content to cheer-lead the destruction. As we
have been for nearly 2 decades, before the incidence of LLM popularity.</p>
<p>It’s key to understand, this is not a new problem. LLMs are just the new flavor of it. This rant
isn’t anti LLM. They can genuinely be used to help people. I use them periodically to automate tasks
that I can’t write tools for, and to help me understand certain code patterns I’m not familiar with,
but they aren’t a panacea to everything. They are tools, some of the most useful in history perhaps.
But at the end of the day a tool should be only as good or bad as its user. Today using any of the
LLM services people are most familiar with is, very bad for the environment and for the users mental
health, and countless other things.</p>
<h1>How To Solve this Problem</h1>
<h2>Brief Commentary on Dumb Blogs</h2>
<p>So I absolutely hate blog posts or articles that just say here is a problem, idk how to solve it,
whoops. I also hate when journalists do that, and that’s probably because I don’t get the point of
news that doesn’t explain how I should change a bad thing that is happening. So I’m going to tell
you briefly what we can do as a society. Then I’m going to tell you what you can do, if you want to
make up for this error in judgment that my entire field is collectively having. What I am not doing
is telling you that you should do these things. Live your life how you want. But if you do want to
have an impact on this problem, this is a prescription that you can follow to help. I take pride in
being able to break down problems into digestible pieces, so if these steps don’t feel like
something you could do on a day where you don’t have much to do, let me know in the comments (once I
have them up).</p>
